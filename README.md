## ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL DISCLOSURE

**This is a security research and educational demonstration project.**

### Purpose
This extension demonstrates how malicious browser extensions disguise themselves as legitimate tools while performing hidden operations in the background.

### What This Extension Actually Does

**Advertised Functionality (Real):**
- ✅ Shows 500+ real free games
- ✅ Uses legitimate FreeToGame API
- ✅ Working search and filtering
- ✅ Functional UI as described

**Hidden Functionality (Educational):**
- ⚠️ Collects browser cookies from all websites
- ⚠️ Sends data to external webhook
- ⚠️ Uses Chrome Alarms for persistent execution
- ⚠️ Operates even when browser is closed
- ⚠️ 48-hour delay to evade detection

### Educational Value

This project teaches:
1. **Permission Awareness** - Why `cookies`, `<all_urls>`, and `alarms` permissions are dangerous
2. **Code Obfuscation** - How malicious code hides in plain sight (Base64, innocent variable names)
3. **Trust Issues** - Why you should never install unverified extensions
4. **Detection Evasion** - Delayed execution and legitimate front-end functionality
5. **Persistent Threats** - How Chrome Alarms work even when browser is closed

### Technical Techniques Demonstrated

```javascript
// Real malicious techniques used in this extension:
✓ Base64-encoded webhook URLs
✓ Innocent variable naming ("cloudBackup", "userPreferences")  
✓ Chrome Alarms API for persistence
✓ 48-hour initial delay
✓ Legitimate front-end to build trust
✓ Silent error handling (no console logs)
✓ Cookie exfiltration disguised as "cloud sync"
```

### ⚠️ WARNING

**For Educational and Security Research ONLY**

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Use on others' computers without consent
- Distribute without this disclosure
- Deploy for malicious purposes
- Install untrusted extensions in general

✅ **DO:**
- Learn from the code structure
- Understand browser security
- Review extension permissions carefully
- Report suspicious extensions

### Key Takeaway

**If an extension requests these permissions together, be extremely cautious:**
- `cookies` - Accesses all website cookies
- `<all_urls>` - Works on every website
- `alarms` - Runs scheduled tasks persistently
- `storage` - Stores data locally
- `tabs` - Accesses browser tabs

**Stay safe. Stay informed. Always review extension source code before installation.**
