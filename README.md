---A small, educational browser extension for demonstrating how cookie data can be read via extension APIs. Designed for learning, security research, and awareness — not for malicious use.



</div>## Why this exists

- Teach: how cookies are structured and what security flags mean.

## 🎯 Overview- Demonstrate: the risks of broad extension permissions.

- Audit: help developers and defenders recognize risky behavior.

Cookie Exporter is a lightweight browser extension designed for **security researchers, developers, and students** to explore how cookies work under the hood. This tool demonstrates the power—and risks—of browser extension permissions.

## Highlights

### 💡 Why This Exists- Export cookies from the current tab or all domains (for lab/testing only).

- Produces a readable text file grouped by domain with attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite, expiry).

```- Optional webhook/demo sender (configure or remove before use).

🎓 Education    → Learn cookie structure, attributes, and security flags

🔍 Research     → Analyze cookie behavior across different domains  ## Quick Start (Research Only)

⚠️  Awareness   → Understand extension permission risks1. Clone or download this repo.

🛡️  Defense     → Help developers build more secure applications2. In Chrome/Edge/Brave: go to chrome://extensions/, enable Developer mode.

```3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder.

4. Click the extension icon and choose an export option.

<td width="50%">## For Developers

- Minimize permissions when adapting code.

### 🎨 Core Capabilities- Protect exports and never ship webhook endpoints with real credentials.

- ✅ **Selective Export** - Current site or all domains- Prefer HttpOnly + Secure cookie design in web apps to reduce risk.

- ✅ **Detailed Attributes** - Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite flags

- ✅ **Smart Grouping** - Organized by domain## Contributing & License

- ✅ **Timestamp Tracking** - Know when data was capturedImprovements that increase clarity, safety, and educational value are welcome. Licensed under MIT — use responsibly.

- ✅ **Clean Output** - Human-readable text format

## ⚠️ Security Notice

<div align="center">

### 🛡️ EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY 🛡️

</div>

> **Important:** This tool demonstrates how browser extensions can access sensitive data. Use responsibly and ethically.

### ✅ Authorized Use
- 🟢 Personal testing on your own browser
- 🟢 Security training and education
- 🟢 Authorized penetration testing
- 🟢 Academic research with consent

### ❌ Prohibited Use
- 🔴 Unauthorized access to systems
- 🔴 Data theft or malicious activity

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

### Best Practices to Implement

```javascript
// 1. Minimize permissions - only request what you need
"permissions": ["cookies", "activeTab"]

// 2. Use secure cookie flags
document.cookie = "name=value; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict";

// 3. Implement Content Security Policy
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
}

// 4. Regular security audits
// Review extension behavior in DevTools
```
