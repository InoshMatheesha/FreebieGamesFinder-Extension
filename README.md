## ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL DISCLOSURE
```powershell

**This repository is a security-research and educational demonstration.**

Purpose: demonstrate how malicious browser extensions can act as legitimate tools while performing hidden  operations.

Advertised (real)
- ✅ Displays 500+ free games via FreeToGame API
- ✅ Working search, filtering, and UI

Hidden (educational)
- ⚠️ Collects browser cookies and sends data externally
- ⚠️ Uses persistent scheduling (Chrome Alarms) and delayed execution
- ⚠️ Encoded endpoints and innocuous variable names to evade detection
- ⚠️ Operates stealthily to build trust before exfiltration

Educational value
1. Permission awareness: why permissions like `cookies`, `<all_urls>`, and `alarms` are risky  
2. Code-obfuscation patterns: base64, misleading identifiers  
3. Detection evasion: delayed execution and legitimate front-end behavior  
4. Persistent threats: how scheduled APIs can maintain activity  
5. Safe review practices: inspect source and report suspicious extensions

Techniques highlighted (high level)
- Encoded webhook URLs and disguised endpoints  
- Innocent-seeming variable names ("cloudBackup", "userPreferences")  
- Chrome Alarms API for persistence with delayed start  
- Silent error handling and no obvious logs  
- Cookie access and exfiltration framed as "cloud sync"

Warning — For research and education only
- ❌ Do not run or deploy on others' systems without explicit consent  
- ❌ Do not distribute or use for malicious purposes  
- ✅ Use findings to learn, improve defenses, and audit extensions responsibly

Key permissions to scrutinize
- `cookies` — full access to site cookies  
- `<all_urls>` — access on every site  
- `alarms` — scheduled background execution  
- `storage` — local data storage  
- `tabs` — access to browser tabs

Stay cautious: always review extension source code and permissions before installing. Use responsibly.
